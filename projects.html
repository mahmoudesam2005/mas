                    We have successfully completed a rehabilitation and redesign project for the Libyan Center for Oncology in Ain Zara,

                    the interior and exterior design of the center. Our specialized team assessed the needs and developed innovative
                    solutions to enhance patient flow and provide a comfortable and safe treatment environment. Close collaboration with the
                    center's team and leveraging the latest engineering technologies and practices ensured our success. Through our efforts,
